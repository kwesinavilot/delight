# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Delight Chrome extension from Chrome's built-in AI models (chrome.aiOriginTrial.languageModel) to the Vercel AI SDK. This migration will provide greater flexibility in choosing and swapping LLM providers, better reliability, and access to more advanced AI models. The migration should maintain all existing functionality while adding the ability to configure different AI providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat functionality to work with external AI providers instead of Chrome's built-in AI, so that I have access to more reliable and advanced AI models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the chat panel THEN the system SHALL initialize a connection to an external AI provider via Vercel AI SDK
2. WHEN I send a message in the chat THEN the system SHALL use the Vercel AI SDK to generate responses instead of Chrome's AI
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing streaming functionality for real-time response display
4. WHEN the chat session is destroyed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up any AI SDK resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to configure which AI provider to use, so that I can choose the best model for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to select from multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. WHEN I change the AI provider THEN the system SHALL update the configuration and use the new provider for subsequent requests
3. IF no API key is configured for a provider THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN I save provider settings THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration in Chrome storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the page summary functionality to be implemented using external AI providers, so that I can get intelligent summaries of web pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a summary length option THEN the system SHALL extract the current page content using the existing readability functionality
2. WHEN page content is extracted THEN the system SHALL send it to the configured AI provider with appropriate prompts for the selected summary length
3. WHEN the AI generates a summary THEN the system SHALL display it in the summary panel with proper formatting
4. IF the page content is too large THEN the system SHALL chunk it appropriately for the AI provider's token limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI integration to be modular and extensible, so that adding new providers or updating existing ones is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the AI service THEN the system SHALL use a provider abstraction layer that can support multiple AI services
2. WHEN adding a new AI provider THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes outside the provider-specific implementation
3. WHEN an AI request fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error handling and fallback options
4. WHEN the extension starts THEN the system SHALL validate the current provider configuration and handle invalid states gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my API keys and sensitive configuration to be stored securely, so that my credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter an API key THEN the system SHALL store it securely using Chrome's storage API with appropriate encryption if available
2. WHEN the extension accesses stored credentials THEN the system SHALL do so only when needed for API calls
3. IF credentials are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to update them
4. WHEN I uninstall the extension THEN the system SHALL ensure all stored credentials are properly removed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the migration to maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality, so that my user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing chat functionality SHALL work identically to the current implementation
2. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts or UI interactions THEN they SHALL behave exactly as before
3. WHEN the extension loads THEN the interface SHALL look and feel the same as the current version
4. IF the new AI provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback rather than silently failing
