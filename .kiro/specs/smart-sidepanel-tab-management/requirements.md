# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND error that occurs when switching from fullscreen mode to sidepanel mode. Currently, when users minimize from fullscreen back to sidepanel, the extension attempts to access a file URL that may no longer exist, resulting in an error page. This enhancement will implement intelligent tab management to ensure the sidepanel always opens on a valid, accessible tab.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user switching from fullscreen to sidepanel mode, I want the sidepanel to open on a valid tab so that I don't encounter file access errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks minimize from fullscreen mode THEN the system SHALL identify the most recently active valid tab
2. IF the current tab has an invalid URL (file://, chrome://, etc.) THEN the system SHALL find an alternative valid tab
3. WHEN no valid existing tabs are found THEN the system SHALL create a new tab with a default URL
4. WHEN switching to sidepanel mode THEN the system SHALL ensure the sidepanel loads properly without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidepanel to intelligently choose the best tab to attach to so that my workflow is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple valid tabs exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recently active tab
2. IF the most recent tab is not suitable THEN the system SHALL check other open tabs in order of recency
3. WHEN creating a new tab is necessary THEN the system SHALL open it with a neutral URL (like about:blank or new tab page)
4. WHEN the sidepanel is activated THEN the system SHALL focus on the selected tab

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent behavior when opening the sidepanel so that I know what to expect regardless of my current browser state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidepanel is opened from any state THEN the system SHALL validate the target tab before proceeding
2. IF tab validation fails THEN the system SHALL implement fallback logic automatically
3. WHEN fallback logic is triggered THEN the system SHALL complete the operation without user intervention
4. WHEN the sidepanel opens successfully THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's chat state and settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to handle edge cases gracefully so that I never see technical error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no tabs are open THEN the system SHALL create a new tab before opening the sidepanel
2. IF all tabs have restricted URLs THEN the system SHALL create a new tab with an accessible URL
3. WHEN Chrome API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with fallbacks
4. WHEN errors occur during tab management THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging but not show them to users
