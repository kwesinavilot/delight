# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current chat system treats each message as a standalone interaction without maintaining conversation history or context. This creates a poor user experience where the AI cannot reference previous messages, follow up on topics, or maintain coherent conversations. This feature will implement proper chat history management and context-aware conversations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Conversation History Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to remember our conversation history so that I can have coherent, context-aware discussions without repeating information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send multiple messages in a chat session THEN the AI SHALL have access to all previous messages in the conversation
2. WHEN I reference something from earlier in the conversation THEN the AI SHALL understand and respond appropriately
3. WHEN I start a new chat session THEN the conversation history SHALL be preserved until explicitly cleared
4. IF the conversation becomes too long THEN the system SHALL intelligently truncate older messages while preserving recent context

### Requirement 2: Message Context Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper message structure that supports conversation history so that the AI providers can receive the full context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are sent to AI providers THEN they SHALL receive the full conversation history in the correct format
2. WHEN the system stores messages THEN it SHALL maintain proper role attribution (user, assistant, system)
3. WHEN conversation history is passed to providers THEN it SHALL be in the format expected by each provider's API
4. IF a provider has token limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently manage context within those limits

### Requirement 3: Context Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation to persist across browser sessions so that I can continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I close and reopen the extension THEN my conversation history SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN I switch between sidepanel and fullscreen modes THEN the conversation context SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN the extension updates THEN existing conversation history SHALL be preserved
4. IF storage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL manage history with appropriate cleanup strategies

### Requirement 4: Context Management Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control my conversation history so that I can start fresh conversations or manage privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to start a new conversation THEN I SHALL be able to clear the current chat history
2. WHEN I want to export my conversation THEN I SHALL be able to save it as a file
3. WHEN I switch AI providers THEN I SHALL have the option to maintain or clear the conversation context
4. IF I want to delete specific messages THEN I SHALL be able to remove them from the history

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat system to remain fast and responsive even with long conversation histories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversations become long THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
2. WHEN context is sent to AI providers THEN it SHALL be optimized to minimize API costs
3. WHEN storing conversation history THEN it SHALL use efficient storage mechanisms
4. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cleanup strategies
